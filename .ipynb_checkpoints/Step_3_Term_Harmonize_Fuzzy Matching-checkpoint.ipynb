    "This notebook is meant to perform fuzzy matching on all rows where an exact match could not be found for the term mapping. Here we again focus on finding matches between our available most specific terms in the data, and the lowest level of our chosen standard ontology (in this case, LLT of the MedDRA v21)."

    "## Notebook conclusions\n",
    "This notebook ran fuzzy matching on any row in the target data that failed to be resolved by exact matching in the previous notebook. Fuzzy matching was run on any available FT1, FT2, and FT3 terms, using the fuzzy wuzzy package in Python. Fuzzy wuzzy returns the 5 top scoring matches.  Be advised that the top scoring match is NOT necessarily the best or even a good match.  To the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy matching algorithm exists that can automatically be expected to identify the best text matches due to a variety of semantic and syntactic challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, before we can move on to the next notebook, some manual steps need to be completed. Specifically first we took \"MH_harmonization_map_5.csv\" and removed all rows with exact matches. This left us with with a dataset with 7115 rows with fuzzy matching results. To facilitate the manual annotation process we rearranged some of the columns and added background colors to the file to highlight where the annotator needed to add the best fuzzy match indexes (FZMatch_Choice_ID_MHTERM), or instead manually copy a best fitting term match from MedDRA LLT's (FZMatch_Copied_Term). This modified file was saved as ('MH_harmonization_map_5_manual_formated.xlsx'). Lastly to distribute the burden of this manual annotation task, we split this dataset into 7 parts (each with about 1000 terms to be manually annotated, wrote up specific instructions to guide these individuals in the manual annotation task, and assigned 7 individuals to complete manual annotation using the fuzzy matching results on their subset of the terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook we set up a quality control pipeline to check these 7 manually annotated files, ensure they had been completed, and that any copied terms in the column (FZMatch_Copied_Term) actually existed in the MedDRA LLT file. Ultimately in the next notebook these 7 files are reintegrated back into a single working mapping file. \n"
